# Pico-W-Controller-PCB-Journey
This documents my journey with my newly built Pico W Controller PCB from beginning to end.

## Phase 1
Phase 1 contains the following directories:

* `pcb_test`: Contains files to test the buttons and potentiometer

* `pico-W2`: Contains the gerber files for the first phase of the PCB design
